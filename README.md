# AMD TressFX

<img src="amd_tressfx_viewer/media/Thumbnail.png" width="480" height="285" />

The TressFX library implements AMD's TressFX hair/fur rendering and simulation technology for DirectX 11. The TressFX technology uses the GPU to simulate and render high-quality, realistic hair and fur. TressFX makes use of the processing power of high-performance GPUs to perform realistic rendering and utilizes DirectCompute to physically simulate each individual strand of hair or fur.

### Prerequisites
* AMD Radeon&trade; GCN-based GPU (HD 7000 series or newer)
* 64-bit Windows&reg; 7 (SP1 with the [Platform Update](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/jj863687.aspx)), Windows&reg; 8.1, or Windows&reg; 10
* Visual Studio&reg; 2012, Visual Studio&reg; 2013, or Visual Studio&reg; 2015

### Getting started
Start with the TressFX viewer to see example content or to check out the code.

* Visual Studio solutions for VS2012, VS2013, and VS2015 can be found in the `amd_tressfx_viewer\build` directory.
* There are also solutions for just the core library in the `amd_tressfx\build` directory.
* Additional documentation is available in the `amd_tressfx\doc` and `amd_tressfx_viewer\doc` directories.

### Premake
The Visual Studio solutions and projects in this repo were generated with Premake. If you need to regenerate the Visual Studio files, double-click on `gpuopen_tressfx_update_vs_files.bat` in the `premake` directory.

This version of Premake has been modified from the stock version to use the property sheet technique for the Windows SDK from this [Visual C++ Team blog post](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vcblog/archive/2012/11/23/using-the-windows-8-sdk-with-visual-studio-2010-configuring-multiple-projects.aspx). The technique was originally described for using the Windows 8.0 SDK with Visual Studio 2010, but it applies more generally to using newer versions of the Windows SDK with older versions of Visual Studio.

The default SDK for a particular version of Visual Studio (for 2012 or higher) is installed as part of Visual Studio installation. This default (Windows 8.0 SDK for Visual Studio 2012 and Windows 8.1 SDK for Visual Studio 2013) will be used if newer SDKs do not exist on the user's machine. However, the projects generated with this version of Premake will use the next higher SDK (Windows 8.1 SDK for Visual Studio 2012 and Windows 10 SDK with Visual Studio 2013), if the newer SDKs exist on the user's machine.

For Visual Studio 2015, this version of Premake adds the `WindowsTargetPlatformVersion` element to the project file to specify which version of the Windows SDK will be used. To change `WindowsTargetPlatformVersion` for Visual Studio 2015, change the value for `_AMD_WIN_SDK_VERSION` in `premake\amd_premake_util.lua` and regenerate the Visual Studio files.

DXUT and ContentExporter are only needed for the viewer, not the core library. Only first-party software (specifically `ags_lib`, `amd_tressfx`, and `amd_lib`) is needed to build the TressFX library.
